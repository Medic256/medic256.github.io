      <p>Over the weekend I competed in a <strong>national‑qualifying Taekwondo tournament</strong> in Chicago and earned:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li><strong>1<sup>st</sup> place</strong> – Traditional Forms (<em>ITF Tul Yoo‑Sin</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>3<sup>rd</sup> place</strong> – Weapons Forms (Sai – Chun Kuhn Taekwondo)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While I’m proud of those results, the true highlight wasn’t the podium—it was a lesson in resilience that unfolded <em>after</em> the competition.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">A Community That Feels Like Family</h2>
      <p>The venue felt less like a sports hall and more like a long‑lost family reunion. Coaches, competitors, and parents cheered <em>every</em> athlete—regardless of school or region. There were no participation trophies, only 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> places—but the atmosphere was fueled by the same energy you find in dojangs worldwide: respect, humility, and shared pride.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">The Board That Wouldn’t Break—Until It Did</h2>
      <p>One moment crystallized the spirit of the day. A young competitor—maybe five years old—stepped up for her board‑breaking event. She shattered the first two boards but the final station refused to yield. Instead of accepting defeat, she made a quiet decision: <strong>she would break that board before leaving.</strong></p>
      <p>After the awards were handed out, she tracked me down on the crowded floor and asked if I would hold the board one more time. We tweaked her stance, adjusted her hip rotation, and on her third attempt she <em>snapped</em> through the board cleanly.</p>
      <p>The look on her face—equal parts pride, relief, and pure joy—was the real victory of the weekend. In that instant, she learned that perseverance, not plaques, defines success.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why I Show Up</h2>
      <p>This experience reminded me that martial arts is ultimately about building <em>people</em>, not just techniques. Every kick and every board is a lesson in resilience. That young martial artist taught me as much as I taught her:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 pl-4 italic my-4">If you keep looking for a way forward, the breakthrough will come—sometimes literally.</blockquote>
      <p>Moments like these fuel my passion to teach, mentor, and keep sharpening my own craft—whether on the mat or in cybersecurity, where perseverance and precision matter just as much.</p>
